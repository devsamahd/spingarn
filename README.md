## JSON Data Structure

```JSON

{category: "new-861", iterations: ["00:06:10", "00:03:06"],‚Ä¶}
category
: 
"new-861"
date
: 
"Tue Oct 11 2022 10:13:06 GMT+0100 (West Africa Standard Time)"
iterations
: 
["00:06:10", "00:03:06"]
```
<br/>

## Challenges
- Updating time: since localStorage has only .setItem() and .getItem() methods I had to create an update function that updates iteration(an Array inside an object that's inside an Array without overiding the data)
